# **ROS Light-Seeking Robot**

This repository contains a ROS-based implementation of a light-seeking robot. The robot scans its environment using BLE sensors to detect light intensity, determines the brightest direction, and navigates toward it. The project is modular, separating concerns into packages for robot control, sensor data handling, and path planning.
